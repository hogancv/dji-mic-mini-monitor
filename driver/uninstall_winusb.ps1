# Undo install_winusb.ps1: remove the driver package and the local signing cert.
#
#   1. deletes the OEM driver package (the one built from djimic_winusb.inf)
#   2. removes the self-signed certificate from
#      LocalMachine\My, LocalMachine\Root, LocalMachine\TrustedPublisher
#   3. rescans so the device falls back to "drivers not installed" (Problem 28)
#
# Audio (MI_01) and HID (MI_00) are never touched -- they use inbox drivers.
# Run elevated.
